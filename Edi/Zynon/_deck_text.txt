€3.5B Opportunity for Automation   

[THE PROBLEM]

[THE OPPORTUNITY]

[THE SOLUTION]

Architecture remains the least automated major industry, 
dominated by a small number of players that slow down 
true innovation. Planning and execution are fragmented 
and human-driven, leading to slow delivery, low utilization 
and structural margin pressure - even as demand grows.

Industrial architecture is the most automation-ready 
segment of the AEC market: standardized components, 
explicit regulations and performance-driven constraints. 
This opens a €3–5B global AEC SaaS opportunity that 
remains structurally under-served by horizontal tools.

Zynon is a vertical SaaS platform that unifies site analysis, 
planning and structural logic into a single algorithmic 
system. It delivers 2–4x faster execution across feasibility, 
planning and technical design, and 3–4x higher revenue 
throughput per team under fixed-fee constraints.

[INFLUENCE]

Zynon emerges from a research lineage in which 
architecture is treated as a system of decisions, not a 
static artifact. The AA DRL framework approaches the field 
as an adaptive, enabling process—integrating computation, 
regulation, material logic and participation into a 
continuously evolving system.

A work in progress, constantly adapting to the needs and 
challenges of a society in a state of perpetual flux. This 
perspective directly underpins Zynon's ethos and 
understanding of the built space, focusing on problem-
solving rather than artistic expression.

[STRUCTURAL DEMAND IS RISING]

[ARCHITECTURE REIMAINS LARGELY MANUAL]

[INDUSTRIAL ARCHITECTURE IS BUILT FOR AUTOMATION]

AI infrastructure, e-commerce, logistics optimization and 
urbanization are driving sustained demand for warehouses, 
data centers and fulfillment hubs. These assets must be 
delivered faster, scale predictably and operate 
continuously.

While most industries have adopted automation and 
algorithmic optimization, architectural planning remains 
dominated by fragmented manual workflows, 
disconnected tools and subjective iteration, creating 
bottlenecks in speed, cost control and predictability.

Industrial projects operate under standardized 
components, explicit regulations and performance-driven 
constraints. Success is measured in time, cost and 
efficiency, not aesthetic expression. This makes industrial 
architecture uniquely suited for algorithmic systems.

[FRAGMENTED, HUMAN-COORDINATED WORKFLOWS]

[DIRECT PERFORMANCE IMPACT]

[ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES]

Data, decisions and accountability are spread across tools, 
specialists and project phases, with no unified system 
linking the lifecycle. As a result, 30-40% of project time is 
spent on manual coordination, repetitive documentation 
and fixing downstream errors. [LINK]

Issues introduced upstream often surface late, triggering 
redesign and rework. Utilization and realization are poorly 
controlled: only ~45% of firms report utilization above 70%, 
and ~41% do not accurately track billed or realized time, 
making time, cost and outcomes difficult to predict. [LINK]

In fixed-fee models, unplanned coordination absorbs 
capacity without increasing revenue. The result is chronic 
margin pressure: ~52% of firms report net margins below 15% 
and 1 in 4 projects runs over budget. Growth becomes 
constrained not by demand, but by operational inefficiency.

Delta+ Market Opportunity
A Structural Response to
Operational & Market Change

Industrial projects require
adaptable solutions.

[CHANGE AS REQUIREMENT]

[RIGIDITY AS A STRUCTURAL LIMITATION]

[POTENTIAL FOR PHASED GROWTH]

Industrial environments are rarely static. Capacity shifts, 
equipment changes and market pressures continuously 
reshape operational needs. Yet buildings are typically 
designed as fixed, one-off solutions.

Expansion, reconfiguration or repurposing, when feasible 
at all, typically requires structural intervention, downtime 
and major capital expenditure — often making adaptation 
economically inefficient.

Modular, expandable structures allow businesses to start 
at the right size and add capacity in phases, aligning 
investment with actual demand rather than locking capital 
upfront.

Market Context
A Large, Growing Market w/ Clear
Structural Gaps

[MARKET STRUCTURE]

The AEC SaaS market is projected to exceed €21B by 2033, 
growing at ~9–10% CAGR. A small number of incumbents 
control most users, operating highly profitable, subscription-
based platforms with ~23–30% EBITDA margins. 

[MARKET PLAYBOOK]

Main players focus on broad, industry-agnostic platforms 
designed for horizontal scale. Innovation is largely absorbed 
through acquisitions, integrating point solutions into existing 
ecosystems. This strategy favors compatibility and market 
coverage over rethinking workflows — leaving feasibility, 
planning and decision automation largely untouched.

[WHERE ZYNON FITS]

Zynon fills this gap with a vertical SaaS platform built for 
industrial projects. By automating planning and design 
decisions around real-world constraints, Zynon replaces 
manual coordination with system-level logic — delivering 
faster timelines, higher predictability and better utilization.

[ADDRESSING CORE INDUSTRY PAIN]

Zynon is engineered specifically for industrial architecture. 
It encodes industrial rules, constraints and operational 
logic directly into the system, enabling levels of 
automation, optimization and predictability that generic 
tools cannot achieve.

Terra, Vector and Delta operate on a shared data 
backbone, eliminating tool fragmentation, data loss and 
manual handovers across project phases. All outputs are 
BIM and CAD compatible, allowing seamless integration 
into existing workflows.

By replacing human-driven coordination with system-level 
logic and manual subjective iteration with automated 
objective design, Zynon reduces rework, improves 
utilization, increases throughput and restores margin 
control in fixed-fee environments.

Fragmented tools, manual handoffs and late-stage issue 
discovery pull principals and senior staff into constant 
firefighting, capping throughput and growth.

Repetition amplifies inefficiency, fixed fees punish waste 
and there is no internal capacity to build automation, making 
integrated external systems the only viable path to scale.

[WHY]

Zynon unifies planning, structural 
logic and execution constraints into 
a single mathematical system, 
replacing fragmented, tool-level 
workflows.

Every deployed project feeds real-
world planning, regulatory and 
execution data back into the 
system, continuously refining its 
optimization logic.

As teams embed Zynon into 
workflows and catalogs, switching 
means losing accumulated project 
intelligence, not just replacing 
software.

Zynon defines a new vertical 
category that horizontal incumbents 
are structurally disincentivized to 
build, while market consolidation 
favors proven platforms.

Planning becomes a matter of selecting from computed 
options, where site conditions, regulations, operational 
needs and cost constraints are evaluated simultaneously 
rather than resolved through manual tradeoffs.

Iteration accelerates, marginal cost collapses and 
throughput increases without proportional growth in teams 
or time, transforming a fixed-fee, labor-bound process into 
a predictable, high-leverage operation.

As rules, constraints and workflows are embedded into a 
single planning logic, each project strengthens the 
system, reducing reliance on manual coordination and 
increasing long-term defensibility.

Pre-Seed Investment Ask
Comprehensive 18-Month budget covering
Development, Validation & Initial Market Expansion

[OVERVIEW]

Zynon requires a total investment of 1,079,345 EUR to 
build, launch and commercially validate the full SaaS suite 
over the 18-month pre-seed cycle.

The budget is structured across four cost pillars: human 
resources, hardware/software, operations and marketing, 
with a conservative buffer included. A full cost breakdown 
is available in the attached financial model.

C. OPERATIONS & MARKETING [Office space, accommodation, 
administrative overhead and early go-to-market spend 
(ads, SEO, advertorials) to drive initial traction 
immediately after launch.]

D. CONTINGENCY BUFFER (10%) [A conservative margin 

ensuring uninterrupted development and operational 
security across the full seed cycle.]

[BREAKDOWN]

A. HUMAN RESOURCES [The largest share supports the 
interdisciplinary team—software engineering, 
architecture, structural consulting, urban strategy, 
data science, commercial operations, marketing and 
UI/UX—required to build and validate the entire system 
end-to-end.]

B. HARDWARE, SOFTWARE & INFRASTRUCTURE [Includes 

workstations, laptops, development equipment and full 
CAD/BIM and productivity software stacks.]

The focus shifts to product refinement through real-world 
use. Operational data is collected to improve reliability, 
performance and coverage. R&D for the structural engine 
(Delta/Delta+) begins, setting the stage for full end-to-end 
project integration.

The next stage centers on converting accumulated data 
into structured learning inputs. Algorithms evolve from 
rule-driven systems into machine-learning models capable 
of recognizing patterns across real-world datasets, 
enabling more adaptive planning and decision support.

With trained models in place and full end-to end coverage 
achieved, the platform shifts from predefined input-
output logic to data-driven reasoning. This enables higher-
order optimization across a richer variable sets and 
supports expansion beyond industrial projects.
