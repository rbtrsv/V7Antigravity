## Hierarchy of Valuation Methods

### i) Public Companies (Mark to Market)

**Primary:** Market price

**Exceptions** (with BoA/IC approval) considering:

**Primary methods:**
1. **Market multiples** applied to last company reported financials
   - Peer selection based on performance (deviations from business plans)
