## David Packard on the Purpose of Business (1960)

> "I think many people assume, wrongly, that a company exists simply to make money. While this is an important result of a company's existence, we have to go deeper and find the real reasons for our being. As we investigate this, we inevitably come to the conclusion that a group of people get together and exist as an institution that we call a company so they are able to accomplish something collectively which they could not accomplish separately. They are able to do something worthwhile — they make a contribution to society."

## Mission

> To wisely allocate our capital for generating returns, but also for providing a sense of responsibility – together with knowledge and integrity – to our entrepreneurs so that they can achieve a lasting impact within the business environment.

## Vision

> To become the leading catalyst of change for a business environment where entrepreneurs can achieve their greatest potential.

> To become the aspirational investor of choice for entrepreneurs who want to build ethical businesses and have a positive impact in society.

## Cum realizăm aceste obiective?

1. **Choosing wisely where we invest** - selecție riguroasă
2. **Fair and transparent** - fără a compromite abordarea business (paradoxal, oferă șanse mai bune la valuations)
3. **Honest support for entrepreneurs** - resurse, business education, chiar suport personal. Encourage, inspire, motivate.
4. **True partners** - nu doar investitori care vor să facă bani
5. **Ecosystem around V7** - LPs, experți, parteneri = asset cheie
6. **Virtuous investment circle** - antreprenorii care exit devin LPs, finanțând următoarele generații
7. **Evergreen and long-term** - acești pași cer timp, short-termism nu ajută
