AGREEMENT ON FUTURE REORGANISATION 
	•	The Parties agree that if the Company seeks to raise capital from external sources in relation to which there is no pre-existing relationship and, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, is required to transform into an investment fund or another type of investment vehicle, they will cooperate and take all necessary steps to facilitate this transformation.
	•	If, upon the Supervisory Board’s analysis, it is determined that it would be more appropriate to either (i) establish a new investment vehicle or (ii) transfer the Company’s activities to an existing authorised investment vehicle (including a shelf fund or investment vehicle), established either in Romania or in another Member State of the European Union (the “New Vehicle”), the Parties agree to cooperate and take all necessary steps in the implementation of such a reorganisation. In both cases, the Parties will take all necessary actions to transfer the Company’s assets (including indirectly) to the New Vehicle, ensuring that each Shareholder retains the same proportional ownership interest as they held in the Company prior to the reorganisation. To this end, the Shareholders undertake to facilitate and effectuate such transaction, as determined by the Supervisory Board acting reasonably and in good faith and having regard to relevant business, marketability and taxation concerns, including by executing and delivering such certifications, affidavits, documents and statements required pursuant to the legal or statutory provisions applicable to the New Vehicle, voting (or abstaining from voting) (to the extent applicable) or executing a written consent (to the extent applicable) to approve such transaction, raising no objection to such transaction, refraining from the exercise of any statutory or legal rights that may inhibit the full implementation of such transaction (including without limitation any minority protections, any statutory dissenter’s rights or rights to fair value), and generally cooperating as shareholders so that the transaction may be implemented as rapidly and efficiently as possible. 
	•	Additionally, the Parties acknowledge that, to comply with applicable laws and regulations, adjustments to the management structure of the Company or the newly designated investment vehicle may be required. Such changes may include adopting a self-management structure or appointing an external manager who is duly authorised to perform the regulated activity. The Parties agree to cooperate and take all necessary steps to implement any such changes, ensuring compliance with the relevant regulatory framework while preserving the key principles and objectives of this Agreement.
	•	In all cases, the Parties will work together to prepare, negotiate, and execute the necessary documentation to implement the transition. The governing documents of the newly established or designated investment entity shall incorporate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, ensuring alignment with its principles and objectives. This Agreement shall continue to govern the Company’s operations and define the rights and obligations of the Parties, subject to any amendments required for regulatory compliance. 
	•	Reorganisation Call Option
	•	If, for the purposes of complying with the provisions of Clause 2.2, Shareholders are required to contribute their share capital participation in the Company as in-kind contribution to the share capital of the new or existing investment vehicle, then the Shareholders shall transfer, to the maximum extent permitted by the Applicable Law, all their shares in the Company, together with all rights attaching to them, free from all Encumbrances, in exchange for shares (or units or other form of capital participation) having rights and preferences which are substantially similar as those attached to the shares issued by the Company and which provide the same ranking, voting rights (to the extent applicable), (the “New Vehicle Contribution”).
	•	Each Shareholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally grant to the Company an option (the “Call Option”), and not an obligation, to acquire all but not less than all of each Shareholder’s shares (the “Called Shares”), upon a first demand in writing (the “Call Option Notice”) delivered to the relevant Shareholder who refuses to proceed in accordance with the provisions of Clause 2.5.1 above or who fails to execute and deliver any documents or take any actions required to implement the New Vehicle Contribution within the timeline specified in Clause 2.5.4 below, and the relevant Shareholder will be bound to transfer all Called Shares if the Company exercises the Call Option. 
	•	The Call Option Notice shall represent the irrevocable acceptance of the Company to acquire all the Called Shares in exchange for the New Vehicle Contribution and, once given, shall represent the between the relevant Shareholder and the Company and:
	•	shall be delivered in writing, signed by or on behalf of the Company;

ROFR AND CAPITAL REDEMPTIONS
General provisions
	•	Notwithstanding the Hard Lock-Up Period or any other restrictions in this Agreement, Shareholders may freely transfer Shares among themselves and to their Affiliates without requiring prior approval, provided such transfers comply with the Applicable Law and the provisions of this Agreement (including subject to adherence, where the case, to the terms and conditions of this Agreement on the basis of the Adherence Deed). The transferee shall assume all rights and obligations of the transferor under this Agreement, including being subject to the same Hard Lock-Up Period timeline as applied to the transferred Shares (i.e., calculated from the date of the original Contribution, not from the date of transfer).
	•	Any redemption of capital contributions referred in this Agreement shall be subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as any specific provisions outlined in this Agreement.
Right of first refusal
	•	Starting with the expiry of the Hard Lock-up Period (whether initial or extended), each Shareholder grants a cascading of right of first refusal upon transfer of their respective Shares in the Company to a Third-Party purchaser (the “ROFR”) exercisable in the following order of priority:
First priority - the Company shall have the first right to purchase the ROFR Shares;
	•	Second Priority - if the Company does not exercise its right or is prohibited by Applicable Law from doing so, the other Shareholders shall have the right to purchase the ROFR Shares on a pro-rata basis.
	•	Subject to the limitations hereunder, where a Shareholder decides to sell and transfer all or part of the Shares (the “Selling Shareholder”) held in the Company from time to time (the “ROFR Shares”), as the case may be, the Shareholder shall give written notice to the Company and the other Shareholders specifying: (i) its intention to transfer the ROFR Shares, (ii) the identity of the relevant Third Party purchaser, (iii) the price per ROFR Share payable by the relevant Third Party (the ”ROFR Price”) and (iv) any other material terms and conditions of the sale including payment terms, conditions precedent, and proposed closing date (the “Sale Notice”).
	•	First priority – Company’s right 
	•	Within 20 Business Days as of receipt of the Sale Notice (the "Company ROFR Period"), the Company shall have the exclusive right, to elect to purchase all (but not less than all) of the ROFR Shares, subject to the provisions of the Applicable Law regarding share buybacks;
	•	The Company may exercise its right by delivering a written notice to the Selling Shareholder, with a copy to all other Shareholders (the "Company ROFR Acceptance Notice"), stating its intention to purchase the ROFR Shares at the ROFR Price and on the other terms set out in the Sale Notice. 
	•	If the Company: (i) delivers a Company ROFR Acceptance Notice within the Company ROFR Period, the Company shall purchase the ROFR Shares in accordance with Clause 7.2.4; or (ii) does not deliver a Company ROFR Acceptance Notice within the Company ROFR Period, or (iii) delivers a written notice declining to exercise its right, or (iv) is prohibited by Applicable Law from purchasing the ROFR Shares, then the right to purchase shall pass to the other Shareholders in accordance with Clause 7.2.3.
	•	Second priority - other Shareholders' right
	•	If the Company does not exercise its right under Clause 7.2.2, the other Shareholders (the "ROFR Shareholders") shall have the right to purchase the ROFR Shares on a pro-rata basis relative to their respective shareholdings in the Company (excluding the Selling Shareholder's shareholding for the purposes of this calculation).
	•	Within twenty (20) Business Days from the earlier of: (i) the expiry of the Company ROFR Period without the Company exercising its right; or (ii) the date on which the Company delivers written notice declining to exercise its right, (the "Shareholders ROFR Period"), each ROFR Shareholder may elect to purchase its pro-rata portion of the ROFR Shares by delivering a written notice to the Selling Shareholder, with a copy to the Company and all other Shareholders (the "Shareholder ROFR Acceptance Notice"). 
	•	Each Shareholder ROFR Acceptance Notice shall specify: (i) the number of ROFR Shares the ROFR Shareholder wishes to purchase (up to its full pro-rata allocation); and (ii) confirmation of the ROFR Shareholder's commitment to purchase at the ROFR Price and on the other terms set out in the Sale Notice. 
	•	Pro-rata allocation shall be calculated as follows: 
ROFR Shareholder's allocation = Total ROFR Shares × (ROFR Shareholder's Shares ÷ Total Shares of all ROFR Shareholders) 
Example: If Selling Shareholder holds 100 shares, ROFR Shareholder A holds 150 shares, and ROFR Shareholder B holds 250 shares: 
Total ROFR Shareholders' shares = 400
A's allocation = 100 × (150/400) = 37.5 shares
	•	B's allocation = 100 × (250/400) = 62.5 shares. 
	•	
	•	
	•	Over-allotment among ROFR Shareholders
	•	If not all ROFR Shareholders have delivered a Shareholder ROFR Acceptance Notice within the Shareholders ROFR Period, or if any ROFR Shareholder has elected to purchase less than its full pro-rata allocation, then the ROFR Shareholders who have delivered a Shareholder ROFR Acceptance Notice (the "Participating Shareholders") shall have the right to purchase the unallocated ROFR Shares (the "Remaining ROFR Shares").
	•	Within five (5) Business Days of the expiry of the Shareholders ROFR Period (the "Over-allotment Period"), the Company shall notify all Participating Shareholders of: (i) the total number of Remaining ROFR Shares; and (ii) each Participating Shareholder's pro-rata allocation of the Remaining ROFR Shares (calculated on the same basis as in Clause 7.2.3(d) but by reference only to the Participating Shareholders' shareholdings).
For example, if the Selling Shareholder holds and wishes to sell 100 shares, ROFR Shareholder A holds 150 shares, and ROFR Shareholder B holds 250 shares: 
Total ROFR Shareholders' shares = 400
A's allocation = 100 × (150/400) = 37.5 shares
	•	B's allocation = 100 × (250/400) = 62.5 shares.
	•	Each Participating Shareholder may elect to purchase its pro-rata allocation of the Remaining ROFR Shares by delivering a written notice to the Selling Shareholder and the Company within five (5) Business Days of receiving the notification under Clause 7.2.4(b).
	•	If, following the Over-allotment Period, there remain ROFR Shares that no ROFR Shareholder has elected to purchase (either because Participating Shareholders did not elect to purchase their full over-allotment allocation, or because no Shareholder ROFR Acceptance Notices were delivered), then: (i) all Shareholder ROFR Acceptance Notices delivered shall become null and void and of no further effect; (ii) no ROFR Shareholder shall be obligated to purchase any ROFR Shares; and (iii) the Selling Shareholder may proceed to sell the ROFR Shares to the Third Party purchaser in accordance with Clause 7.2.6.
	•	To the extent that the Company and/or any ROFR Shareholders have validly exercised their right to purchase ROFR Shares in accordance with Clauses 7.2.2, 7.2.3, and 7.2.4, the sale and purchase of such ROFR Shares shall be completed on the following terms:
	•	The sale and purchase of the ROFR Shares shall occur and be completed (including full payment of the purchase price) within twenty (20) Business Days from the later of: (i) the expiry of the Shareholders ROFR Period (if only Shareholders are purchasing and no over-allotment is required); (ii) the expiry of the Over-allotment Period (if over-allotment occurs); or (iii) the expiry of the Company ROFR Period (if only the Company is purchasing), or on such later date as may be required to comply with the Applicable Law (regulatory approvals) or as may be agreed in writing between the Selling Shareholder and the purchaser(s); 
	•	The purchase price per ROFR Share shall be the ROFR Price, payable in immediately available funds by wire transfer to the bank account designated by the Selling Shareholder;
	•	The ROFR Shares shall be transferred free and clear of any and all Encumbrances;
	•	Upon receipt of the full purchase price, the Selling Shareholder shall execute and deliver all documents and take all steps necessary and reasonably required, in accordance with the Applicable Law and the Articles of Association, for effecting the transfer of the ROFR Shares, including: (i) share transfer instruments in the form required by Romanian law; (ii) updated shareholders' registry reflecting the transfer; (iii) any notifications or registrations required with the Trade Registry; and (iv) delivery of any share certificates or other evidence of ownership; 
	•	Each party shall bear its own costs, fees, and expenses in connection with the transfer, shall be borne equally by the Selling Shareholder and the purchaser(s) (or, if there are multiple purchasers, allocated pro-rata among them based on the number of ROFR Shares each is acquiring).
	•	Sale to Third Party purchaser
	•	The Selling Shareholder may sell all (but not less than all) of the ROFR Shares to the Third Party purchaser identified in the Sale Notice only if: (i) neither the Company nor any ROFR Shareholder has validly exercised the right to purchase the ROFR Shares in accordance with this Clause 7.2; or (ii) the Company and/or ROFR Shareholders who delivered acceptance notices fail to complete the purchase within the timeline specified in Clause 7.2.5(a) (and any agreed extensions) without valid cause;
	•	Any such sale to a Third Party purchaser must be completed within ninety (90) Business Days from the later of: (i) the expiry of the Shareholders ROFR Period (or Over-allotment Period, if applicable) without the ROFR being exercised; or(ii) the date on which the Company and/or ROFR Shareholders fail to complete the purchase in accordance with Clause 7.2.5; (the "Third Party Sale Period");
	•	The sale to the Third Party purchaser must be on terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the Selling Shareholder than those set out in the Sale Notice, including: (i) a price per share equal to or greater than the ROFR Price; (ii) payment terms no less favorable than those specified in the Sale Notice; and (iii) no additional material conditions or obligations imposed on the Selling Shareholder;
	•	The Third Party purchaser must: (i) undergo and successfully complete a KYC process in accordance with standards approved by the Supervisory Board (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and to be provided within ten (10) Business Days of receiving the KYC documentation); and (ii) execute and deliver an Adherence Deed, thereby agreeing to be bound by all terms and conditions of this Agreement;
	•	The Supervisory Board may extend the Third Party Sale Period for up to an additional sixty (60) Business Days upon written request from the Third Party purchaser if: (i) the acquisition of the ROFR Shares triggers regulatory approval requirements (specific regulatory approvals); and (ii) the Third Party purchaser provides reasonable evidence that it has filed for such approvals and is diligently pursuing them; such extension request and consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
	•	If the transfer to the Third Party purchaser is not completed by the end of the Third Party Sale Period (including any approved extensions), the Selling Shareholder may sell the ROFR Shares only by recommencing the ROFR procedure set out in this Clause 7.2 from the beginning, including delivery of a new Sale Notice.

	•	The Executive Management Team shall provide the GMS with detailed reports outlining the calculation and allocation of the Aggregate Expenses annually, ensuring full transparency. These reports may be subject to review by an internal auditor or external auditor of the Company.
	•	Performance Remuneration 
	•	In addition to the Base Remuneration, the Executive Management Team shall be entitled to receive a performance related remuneration (the “Performance Remuneration”) in relation to each financial year, exclusively in the form of an award under a stock option plan to be adopted by the Supervisory Board in accordance with Clause 6.2.14(iii)(the “SOP”), the main terms of which are set out in Appendix 7 to this Agreement and subject to the provisions of this clause 8.2.4. The number of Shares to be granted to the Executive Management Team as Performance Remuneration in relation to any financial year shall be decided by the GMS (the “Annual SOP Award”) in the meeting approving the financial statements for the respective financial year. The GM shall decide the split of the Annual SOP Award between the members of the Executive Management Team within twenty (20) Business Days as of the date of the GMS resolution approving the Annual SOP Award. Such split shall be subject to the confirmation of the Supervisory Board.  
	•	Subject to the provisions of this clause 8.2.4, the Performance Remuneration shall be allocated starting with the financial year 2026, with the first Performance Remuneration calculated by reference to the financial year 2025. 
	•	The Performance Remuneration shall only be allocated if the Company achieves a minimum annual realised IRR/Shareholder of EURIBOR3M + 5% (the “Hurdle Rate”), calculated in the currency of the Company’s financial statements. If the Company fails to achieve the Hurdle Rate in any given year, no Performance Remuneration shall be payable. The Hurdle Rate shall be calculated on an annual basis, following the approval of the annual financial statements and by reference to the realised IRR calculated on the basis of the approved financial statements for the previous year. For the purposes of this clause 8.2.4, the references to “realised IRR” shall refer to IRR where there is an actual cash return on the Company’s Portfolio Projects, computed for any Portfolio Projects that a) have some cash return and b) have either exited or have a net positive cash flow. 
	•	Upon meeting the Hurdle Rate for a year, the Executive Management Team shall be entitled to receive a Performance Remuneration in an aggregate amount equal to 20% of the IRR/Shareholder for the previous year less the Aggregate Expenses and less an amount equal to the Hurdle Rate (the “Excess Return”). If the realised IRR/Shareholder exceeds 25% in a year, the Performance Remuneration payable by such Shareholder in connection with the respective year shall be increased by an additional 10% share of the portion of the realised IRR exceeding this threshold.
	•	Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 8.2.4, no Performance Remuneration shall be payable in respect of any year unless and until the realised IRR/Shareholder has exceeded the highest previously recorded realised IRR for which Performance Remuneration was paid (the “High-Water Mark” or “HWM”). If, in any given year, the realised IRR does not exceed the High-Water Mark, no Performance Remuneration shall be paid for that year, and any future Performance Remuneration shall only become payable once the realised IRR surpasses the previously established High-Water Mark.
	•	For the avoidance of doubt, if the realised IRR in any year falls below the High-Water Mark, the Executive Management Team shall not be entitled to Performance Remuneration for subsequent years until the realised IRR once again exceeds the prior High-Water Mark.
	•	In order to calculate the Performance Remuneration in relation to each Shareholder, the following formulas shall apply:
⦁ NAV_start(i) = Shareholder’s NAV prior valuation date (after fees).
	•	⦁NAV_flows(i) = net subscriptions/redemptions during the period, time-weighted: each cash flow CF_k at day t_k contributes CF_k × (1 + r_daily)^(Δdays), where r_daily = Hurdle Rate/365.
⦁ NAV_end(i) = investor’s NAV at current valuation date (before Performance Remuneration accrual for the period).
⦁ Hurdle Accrual = [NAV_start(i) × (1 + r_daily)^(days)] + Σ CF_k × (1 + r_daily)^(Δdays) − [NAV_start(i) + Σ CF_k].
⦁ Excess Return(i) = max{0, [NAV_end(i) − (NAV_start(i) + Σ CF_k + Hurdle Accrual)]}, subject to HWM: Exces_HWM(i) = max{0, NAV_end(i) − HWM_base(i)}, where HWM_base(i) = max{prior HWM(i), NAV_start(i) + Σ CF_k + Hurdle Accrual}.
⦁ Performance Remuneration(i) = 20% × min{Excess Return(i), Exces_HWM(i)}.
ADMISSION OF SUBSEQUENT SHAREHOLDERS
	•	Any Subsequent Shareholder must, as a condition to becoming a Shareholder, sign an Adherence Deed in advance, thereby unconditionally agreeing to and accepting all terms and provisions of this Agreement. By executing the Adherence Deed, the Subsequent Shareholder undertakes to be fully bound by all applicable Clauses herein. The Company shall have no obligation to register or otherwise recognize any Subsequent Shareholder in the shareholders’ registry unless and until it has submitted an original signed copy of the Adherence Deed.
	•	Any Subsequent Shareholder that is not an Affiliate of an existing Shareholder shall be required to make a minimum capital Contribution in the amount of the lower of EUR 250,000 and 1% of the Assets at the time of such Contribution.
INVESTMENT STRATEGY 
	•	The Company’s Investment Strategy (including investment restrictions, exceptions, and risk management provisions) are included in Appendix 2 of this Agreement. 
	•	The Investment Strategy shall be reviewed and reapproved every 5 years by Supervisory Board to ensure alignment with the Company's objectives and regulatory requirements, subject to Clause 6.1.3(x). Additionally, an earlier review may be triggered by the occurrence of any significant event, including but not limited to: (i) authorization as fund or investment vehicle or any other solvent reorganization in accordance with the provisions of clause 2 of this Agreement; (ii) trading venue listing; and/or (iii) major changes in the shareholder structure of the Company. 
CO-INVESTMENT 
	•	Shareholders shall have a preferential right, but not an obligation, to participate in co-investment opportunities alongside the Company). The Company shall, in good faith and on a reasonable basis, notify the Shareholders in writing of any such co-investment opportunity as soon as practicable, providing sufficient details regarding the terms, structure, and timing of the investment to enable the Shareholders to assess their interest in participating.
	•	In the event that multiple Shareholders express interest in a given co-investment opportunity, the available co-investment amount shall be allocated among such interested Shareholders on a pro-rata basis, in proportion to their respective shareholding in the Company’s share capital at the relevant time. If any Shareholder elects not to participate in full or in part, the unallocated portion of the co-investment amount may be offered to the remaining interested Shareholders on a pro-rata basis or otherwise allocated at the discretion of the Board.
	•	Each participating Shareholder shall be responsible for conducting his/her/its own due diligence, making his/her/its own investment decision, and bearing all risks associated with its participation in the co-investment opportunity. The Company makes no representations or warranties regarding the performance or risks of any co-investment opportunity. 
	•	Each participating Shareholder shall bear its own costs, fees, and expenses incurred in connection with the co-investment opportunity, including but not limited to legal, tax, due diligence, and transaction-related expenses. The Company shall not be responsible for any losses, liabilities, or obligations incurred by a Shareholder in connection with a co-investment, and each participating Shareholder shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, and officers from any claims arising from such participation.
	•	Any co-investment made by a Shareholder shall be held separately from its shareholding in the Company and shall not be subject to the provisions of this Agreement. The terms of any exit from a co-investment shall be governed by the applicable investment agreement or arrangements in place for that particular opportunity.
REPORTING
	•	The Company shall provide timely updates to its Shareholders through regular and interim reports, as detailed below:
	•	Regular reports: 
	•	Quarterly Reports. Delivered via conference calls or face-to-face meetings, these reports shall include: (a) Performance Summary: NAV, realized and unrealized gains/losses, and other key performance indicators, (b) Portfolio Updates: highlights of successes, lowlights of challenges, and significant developments in Portfolio Projects, (c) pipeline development: updates on new investment opportunities under consideration, (d) cash flow summary and costs: overview of cash inflows, outflows, and associated costs; 
	•	Annual Reports: Presented during face-to-face meetings, these reports shall include: (a) Financial Statements: balance sheet, income statement, and other relevant disclosures, (b) Annualized Performance Metrics: NAV, realized/unrealized gains, IRR estimates, and other financial indicators, (c) Detailed Portfolio updates: valuations, significant developments, and financial projections for Portfolio Projects, (d) engagement with Portfolio Projects leadership: opportunities to meet CEOs and entrepreneurs from portfolio companies for direct updates and insights; 
	•	Interim Updates. The Company shall promptly communicate material developments via interim updates when triggered by significant events, such as: (a) exits or new investments, (b) major developments within Portfolio Projects, (c) capital redemption requests or buybacks, (d) market disruptions that may significantly impact the Portfolio Projects. 
	•	Challenge of NAV determination
	•	Any Shareholder or group of Shareholders holding individually or in aggregate at least [5%] of the share capital of the Company has the right to challenge the NAV communicated by the Company, provided that the challenged NAV differs by at least [5%] from what the challenging Shareholder(s) believes to be the correct NAV. 
	•	Any Shareholder or group of Shareholders challenging the communicated NAV must submit a written notice to the Company (the “NAV Challenge Notice”) within thirty (30) Business Days from the date on which the NAV was communicated to the Shareholders, which shall set out in reasonable detail: (a) the grounds for the challenge; (b) the Shareholder's preliminary calculation of what it believes the correct NAV should be, including any specific assets or valuations that the Shareholder believes are incorrectly valued, as well as the Shareholder's view of the correct valuation and the basis for such view. Failure to submit a NAV Challenge Notice within the thirty (30) Business Day period shall result in a complete and irrevocable waiver of the Shareholder's right to challenge that particular NAV determination. For the avoidance of doubt, this waiver applies only to the specific NAV determination and does not affect the Shareholder's right to challenge future NAV determinations.
	•	Upon receipt of a NAV Challenge Notice, the Company shall, within fifteen (15) Business Days, acknowledge receipt and engage in good faith discussions with the challenging Shareholder(s) to resolve the matter. The Company shall provide any additional information or clarification reasonably requested by the challenging Shareholder(s) in connection with the NAV determination.
	•	The Company and the challenging Shareholder(s) shall use their best efforts to resolve the challenge amicably within fifteen (15) Business Days from the date of the Company’s acknowledgement of the NAV Challenge Notice.
	•	If the Company and the challenging Shareholder(s) are unable to reach an agreement regarding the NAV within the period set out under Clause 12.4.4, the challenging Shareholder may, by written notice to the other, refer the matter for determination to an independent, reputable expert (the “Independent Expert”). Such Independent Expert shall be appointed by mutual agreement of the Company and the challenging Shareholder(s), or, failing such agreement within five (5) Business Days, by resolution of the GMS convened for such purpose by the Company among the candidates proposed by both the Company and the challenging Shareholder(s).
	•	The Independent Expert shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The Company and, if the case, the challenging Shareholder(s) shall provide the Independent Expert with all information and assistance reasonably required for the purpose of making a determination. The Independent Expert shall make a determination of the NAV in accordance with the Valuation Methodology and the terms of this Agreement within twenty (20) Business Days of appointment, or such longer period as the Company and the challenging Shareholder(s) may agree in writing.
	•	The determination of the Independent Expert shall, in the absence of manifest error, be final and binding on the Company and all Shareholders for the purposes of the relevant NAV determination. The costs of the Independent Expert shall be allocated as follows: (a) If the Independent Expert determines a NAV that differs from the Company's NAV by more than [5%], the costs shall be borne entirely by the Company; (b) If the Independent Expert determines a NAV that differs from the Company's NAV by less than [5%], the costs shall be borne entirely by the challenging Shareholder(s). 
	•	For the purposes of this Clause 12.4.7, the percentage difference shall be calculated as: |Independent Expert NAV - Company NAV| ÷ Company NAV × 100< (e) If multiple Shareholders join in the challenge, the costs allocated to the challenging Shareholders under item (b) above shall be divided among them pro-rata based on their respective shareholdings.  
	•	For the avoidance of doubt, any challenge to the NAV and the process set out in this clause shall not suspend or delay the exercise of any rights or the performance of any obligations by the Shareholders or the Company under this Agreement, except to the extent that such rights or obligations are expressly dependent on the final determination of the NAV. 
	•	
	•	
	•	
	•	
	•	Any Shareholder who submits a NAV Challenge Notice in bad faith or for the purpose of delaying payments or distributions shall be liable to the Company and other affected Shareholders for any damages caused by such delay.
	•	Any change in NAV shall affect all operations, whether suspended or not, based on NAV, from that moment onwards.
	•	If a Shareholder (or group of Shareholders) challenges three (3) or more consecutive NAV determinations, and in each case:  the Independent Expert determines a NAV that differs from the Company's NAV by less than [5%] each time, then such Shareholder(s) shall be prohibited from challenging the next [two (2)] NAV determinations.
